## API Reference
This application leverages the [PokÃ©API](https://pokeapi.co/), a free and open RESTful API that provides rich data about the PokÃ©mon universe. It offers structured access to PokÃ©mon species, abilities, moves, stats, and more â€” making it an ideal backend data source for building interactive PokÃ©mon-based applications.

## Project Structure
### Pages (`app/`)
The `app/` directory contains all the route-based UI pages for PokÃ©mon, abilities, moves, and species. Dynamic routes and layouts are also defined here.
```
src/
â””â”€â”€ app/
â”œâ”€â”€ abilities/          # Abilities listing and dynamic detail pages
â”œâ”€â”€ moves/              # Moves listing and dynamic detail pages
â”œâ”€â”€ pokemon/            # PokÃ©mon listing and dynamic detail pages
â”œâ”€â”€ species/            # Species listing and dynamic detail pages
â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx          # Global layout wrapper
â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx            # Home page entry
â””â”€â”€ globals.css         # Global styles
```
### API Routes (`app/api/`)
These are serverless route handlers used to fetch data from the PokÃ©API. Each route is scoped to its respective feature (abilities, moves, etc).
```
src/
â””â”€â”€ app/
â””â”€â”€ api/
â”œâ”€â”€ abilities/         # API route handlers for abilities
â”œâ”€â”€ moves/             # API route handlers for moves
â”œâ”€â”€ pokemon/           # API route handlers for PokÃ©mon
â””â”€â”€ species/           # API route handlers for species
```
### Components (`components/`)
This folder holds reusable UI components like cards and floating UI elements that are used throughout the app.
```
src/
â””â”€â”€ components/
â”œâ”€â”€ PokemonCard.tsx     # Card component for displaying individual PokÃ©mon
â”œâ”€â”€ SpeciesCard.tsx     # Card component for displaying species info with dynamic color
â””â”€â”€ ui/
â””â”€â”€ floating-dock.tsx   # Floating navigation dock component
```
### Lib (`lib/`)
Utility functions and shared helpers for the application logic live here.
```
src/
â””â”€â”€ lib/
â””â”€â”€ utils.ts           # Shared utilities and helper functions
