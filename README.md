## API Reference
This application leverages the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), a free and open RESTful API that provides rich data about the Pokémon universe. It offers structured access to Pokémon species, abilities, moves, stats, and more — making it an ideal backend data source for building interactive Pokémon-based applications.

## Project Structure
### Pages (`app/`)
The `app/` directory contains all the route-based UI pages for Pokémon, abilities, moves, and species. Dynamic routes and layouts are also defined here.
```
src/
└── app/
├── abilities/          # Abilities listing and dynamic detail pages
├── moves/              # Moves listing and dynamic detail pages
├── pokemon/            # Pokémon listing and dynamic detail pages
├── species/            # Species listing and dynamic detail pages
├── layout.tsx          # Global layout wrapper
├── page.tsx            # Home page entry
└── globals.css         # Global styles
```
### API Routes (`app/api/`)
These are serverless route handlers used to fetch data from the PokéAPI. Each route is scoped to its respective feature (abilities, moves, etc).
```
src/
└── app/
└── api/
├── abilities/         # API route handlers for abilities
├── moves/             # API route handlers for moves
├── pokemon/           # API route handlers for Pokémon
└── species/           # API route handlers for species
```
### Components (`components/`)
This folder holds reusable UI components like cards and floating UI elements that are used throughout the app.
```
src/
└── components/
├── PokemonCard.tsx     # Card component for displaying individual Pokémon
├── SpeciesCard.tsx     # Card component for displaying species info with dynamic color
└── ui/
└── floating-dock.tsx   # Floating navigation dock component
```
### Lib (`lib/`)
Utility functions and shared helpers for the application logic live here.
```
src/
└── lib/
└── utils.ts           # Shared utilities and helper functions
```
